What it Means to be Team Serious

These are like the "I Have a Dream" speeches of Team Serious.

Most of this is total crap, but I'm particularly baffled by this Sandwich Punch reference. Seriously, do you have any idea what the fuck you're talking about? Fine, complain that everyone here doesn't want to test Nourishing Lich or Shaman's Trance TPS or trash like that. Whatever. But when you seriously somehow cite Sandwich Punch of all things as a strike against Vintage in general, I just can't stay on the sidelines. Show me some example of ANYONE not in the game getting a sandwich punched. ANYONE at ANY EVENT. It's not the way it works. And if it happened (say, someone thought X person was in and they were not), YOU GET A NEW SANDWICH. If you seriously are complaining that fun games that get people to go out to dinner after the tournament and make for awesome stories to tell with friends are somehow BAD for the community, you need to do some serious rethinking. Things like that give people who are not on a first-name basis with vintage regulars something interesting to talk about. It gives you a reason to go out to eat with people and get to know them. It is a community builder 100%. So really, complain that people don't like awful ideas here, and complain about nicknames because you're apparently too old for humor, and complain about MWS doing everything Vintage tournaments do, but please, please, please, don't complain about sandwich punch. 1000% Serious.

Finally uploaded media from my phone. Here is the infamous, spirits-induced speech from G! Audio is hard to hear since a lot of people were talking, but if you crank the volume up you can hear him.

Team Serious Membership Policy

Though "We are friends; we have fun" is high on our list of life-guiding principles, gaining access to the Team Serious Member Boards is a right to be earned. Team Serious Members should exhibit the highest qualities of Vintage gamesmanship, strategy, and cameraderie. The process follows:

1. Prospective member registers an account on this website, http://www.teamserious.net and requests admittance to the Team Serious Member Boards.

2. A current member of Team Serious vouches for the prospective member's quality as a tournament Vintage player, Vintage deck designer, and community member.

3. A poll is created with options "Yes" and "No." Current team members vote on the prospective member's admittance. Poll answers are not locked and may be altered by voters as they wish.

4. Over the course of one month from the poll's creation, current team members should debate the prospective member's merits and qualifications for acceptance. This can include references to posts and writing on this website, The Mana Drain, and elsewhere; personal anecdotes; and other evidence felt relevant.

5. If a "No" voter finds that his concerns are unanswered by the offered evidence, he should explain his views with the goal of either rectifying those concerns with more appropriate evidence (thus changing the "No" vote to "Yes") or convincing others of the prospective member's undeservedness.

6. Acceptance must be unanimous. At the end of one month from the poll's creation, any one "No" vote will prevent the prospective member from gaining admission to the Team Serious Member Boards.

7. If the poll is unanimous in favor of acceptance, the poll is deleted, and the prospective member is granted full access to the Team Serious Member Boards.

8. If after two weeks [edited: June 7, 2010] the poll is not unanimous in favor of acceptance, the prospective member will be informed of the decision and will be allowed to try again after five months.

Members of Team Serious should comport themselves in a manner befitting the team's reputation. Seriously.

Also, upon acceptance into the Team Serious Member Boards and at six-month intervals thereafter, all members will be required to pay dues for website maintenance and for the upkeep of a Star City Games Premium account. Notices about these dues and instructions necessary to pay them will be posted in the Team Serious Member Boards. A member who goes a full cycle without paying dues will have his access to the Team Serious Member Boards revoked until he is paid in full.
