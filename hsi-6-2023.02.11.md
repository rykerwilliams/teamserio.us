After a hiatus in 2021, Hazardvitational returned this year for the 6th installment. We join our hero in the midst of a house move and familial growth, a hectic time for even a such a monumental mage such as Matt Hazard. With the blessing of his partner, he endeavoured to once again bring the team together in celebration of his birth, with friendship and cards. 

With such things filling his mind day to day, he enlisted me to help put things together and herd the cats as best as possible. As I am wont to do, I set about making some promotional materials. See above :)

Folks were generally stoked already to come together and especially more so since only me and Duane got to meet at Eternal Weekend; last TSI was The Land 3 in June 2022 and folks were pretty excited to play Vintage. Thanks as always to the Hazard family for opening their homes to all of *Those Ohio Idiots* once again. Happy Birthday Matt!

# Pre-Tournament Gathering
Folks from beyond Ohio were coming in to town for the gathering, so two AirBnBs were acquired. In a new twist on responsiblity sharing, those interested in staying signed up and Josh rolled to randomly assign the responsibility of booking the spot. Also noted was the fact that we got more than one AirBnB; weirdly, stacking 8 deep into a 2 man hotel room doesn't have the same appeal as it for some reason did years ago. #old

Folks started to descend upon Columbus and surrounding areas on Thursday or so. The tournment venue is conveniently located near a lot of eateries and provions suppliers in Columbus. The AirBnBs were well stocked.

# Stream

I initially wanted to do some remote commentary for the stream. I even asked Kevin Cron and he agreed to try it. But the reality of the coordination was a bit much. Seriouso [Rob Wilson](https://twitter.com/Robert_H_Wilson) agreed to bring his very sophisticated [Buffalo Chicken Dip Legacy](https://twitter.com/BcdLegacy) setup to get us on stream. Big ups to Rob for his efforts to get us live. You can view the VODs of the stream on his channel for now: https://www.twitch.tv/BuffaloChickenDipLegacy

Look for them on the Team Serious YouTube channel around the twelfth of Perhaps Someday.

# Trivia and Beyond
As the Top 8 started up, Nat patiently waited to deploy his latest Trivia on the team. I am enamored with the Nat's wonderful ability to mix media and subject matter, making seemingly the perfect of mix of magic and muggle questions for our age bracket. Folks were weirdly very into playing magic cards.
