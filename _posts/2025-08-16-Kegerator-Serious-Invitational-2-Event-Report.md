14 mages gathered in Ann Arbor, to drink a keg and battle Vintage! Hosted by Kevin Poesnich, the event featured food, friendship and the debut of ((Tezzeret, Cruel Captain)).

## Food and Drink

This year, Kevin upgraded from a quarter keg to a half keg, and let flow [Bell's Two Hearted](https://bellsbeer.com/beers/two-hearted-ale/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with a great supply of sliced oranges.

One aspect of TSI's that is sorely missed during sanctioned tournaments is breaking for food. After Round 1, we broke for lunch, with [Zingerman's Deli](https://www.zingermansdeli.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} being provided once again. *You really can taste difference.* (This is their tag line.) 

Various delicious sandwich builds were created; None were punched.

Of course, copious other foods were offered up by our gracious host. Many donuts were consumed, one half at a time.
