16 mages gathered to battle Vintage and celebrate the new house of friend and teammate Kevin Poesnich. What went down in the Vexing Bauble era?

## Food and Drink

As the name implies, we were treated to on-tap [Oberon](https://bellsbeer.com/beers/oberon-ale/) with a great supply of sliced oranges. An additional auxillary cooler was filled with other beverages.

After round 1, [Zingerman's Deli](https://www.zingermansdeli.com/) was provided for lunch. You really can taste difference.

## Vintage

### Meta Game

Blue / Blue Combo (6):

- Oath (3) - Rajah, Bret, Jimmy
- Jewel Shops - Jerry
- Lurrus - Andy
- UW Kitten Mage - Hockey

Bazaar (2):
- Hogaak - Mike O.
- Dredge - Kevin

Workshops: (4)
- KCI - Steven
- Null Rod Shops (2) - Duane, Nam
- Fleshraker / Smelting Vat - Angelo

Combo: (1)
- Doomsday - Rolko

Misc: (3)
- GR Hate - Caffrey
- Classic Mono Black Null Rod - Shaman Ben
- Classic Food Chain Goblins - Andrew

Players brought a large diversity of decks, with Oath being the most played archetype. Notably absent from the field was the Mono-White Initiative menace. Having taken several years break from Vintage proper, Shaman Ben returned to the TSI fray with a flourish! He brought Mono-Black Classic, a format that only plays cards legal up to Scourge, while Brother Andrew decided to compete with his Classic Food Chain goblins. Further spice was brought by TSI: The Land 5 champion Eric Caffrey, choosing to battle with Bloodbraid Elves in addition to his Null Rods, Blood Moons and Moon Mages.

And while Ben didn't win any matches, I know he did claim the elusive Vintage achievement of killing someone with a Nantuko Shade in 2024 Vintage. Eric also got on the board with an aggro achievement, winning at least one game off the back of his Bloodbraid elf.

### Standings

After 4 rounds of Swiss, the standings were as follows:
