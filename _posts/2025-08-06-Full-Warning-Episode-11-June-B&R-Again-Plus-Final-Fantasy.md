<p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>
<p>With the recent 'no changes' <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">decision</a> for the B&amp;R, the Vintage community is seemingly left with the format that they are going to get for Eternal Weekends 2025. Now, given this stance and not expecting changes before Eternal Weekend, what can Vintage players come up with to complain about? Un-restrictions, of course!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Mike Solymossy forgot his powerpoint slides, but he digs pretty deep into the crates to review THIRTEEN cards that he says should be unrestricted. We then pull out Jimmy's list from his <a href="https://teamserio.us/posts/20240416_Full-Warning-Episode-4-HSI-7-Vintage-BR-and-Columbus-Food-Talk" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">last appearance</a> on the show and compare some notes with the current format, and finally come up with "Our Totally Official, Unqualified Suggestion For Un-Restriction". </p>
<p>Hint: It rhymes with "Bog Broth's Chill". Skip ahead if that's what you came for!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We start things off hot with a head-to-head game between our guests, to determine right away the "Winner of Episode 11". Find it <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/games/argentpenguin/magic-the-gathering---real-cards-or-not" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">here</a> and play along!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Next, we give Jimmy a chance to respond to his haters (Angelo) and regale us with his tales of glory and dominance. Jimmy captured the prestigious <a href="https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/281771" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">Team Serious Middle School Intercontinental Championship</a> at The Land 6 using his (Jaco's) trusty Rbg Goblins to dominate a field that really just wasn't ready for the little green guys. Check out the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7mT2eVHGBPFgqvfgViuIR4hF7rp-0_wX&amp;si=u2T5t8iarZs-t0K5" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">VODs here</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>And since we are ostensibly a Vintage magic podcast, we made sure to include some relevant content! Podcast newcomer-cum-Vintage magic veteran Mike Solymossy joins us to review his <a href="https://www.melee.gg/Decklist/View/a9fc8957-6be0-4849-92a2-b31f0000b0e0" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">T8 Final Fantasy blue brew</a>, featuring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier" target="_blank" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer">Vivi Orintier</a>! Mike takes us through a little bit of his magical journey and how he got back into Vintage magic in more recent years, after selling out of Vintage cards 10 years ago. He brings us up to date on his current take and approach to Magic, having recently attended also The Land 6, and noting the old truism: "The best part of Magic is the gathering"!His new approach has lead him back to some familiar territory: making the top 8. Mike goes in depth with a review and analysis of the deck's angles, lines, and construction philosophies, which any serious Magic player will appreciate. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Finally, we visit the Swag Corner, where we discuss things Summer and Foil, but decidedly not both.</p>
