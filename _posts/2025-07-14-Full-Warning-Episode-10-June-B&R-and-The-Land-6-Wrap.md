<p><strong>Show Notes</strong>
We welcome back guest Duane Haddix, this time as the TSI: Land 6 - Back to Basics Vintage Champion. After some dark times following the restriction of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/212/vexing-bauble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Vexing Bauble</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/259/urzas-saga " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Urza&#39;s Saga </a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/7/glaring-fleshraker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Fleshraker</a> Shops seems to be back! Duane gives all due credit to the online innovator <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/player/crK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">crK</a> and other online players, who seem to have found a way forward for this deck, and Duane&#39;s commanding performance at <a href="https://melee.gg/Tournament/View/281768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">The Land 6</a> tournament seems to have cemented that.

And so the future seems to be a bit brighter this year, as we head into an <a href="https://magic.gg/news/announcing-upcoming-rcqs-spotlight-events-eternal-weekends-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">NA Eternal Weekend 2025</a> that will not include any further scheduled changes to the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-june-30-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Vintage B&amp;R</a>. We dig into everyone&#39;s reaction and discuss what we wanted to see vs. what we expected to see. </p>
<p>
If there were any possible storm clouds threatening this bright future, they might come in the form of a 3 generic mana Planeswalker named <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/2/tezzeret-cruel-captain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Tezzeret, Cruel Captain</a>. Cited in the recent B&amp;R as a reason to NOT make changes in Vintage, this card seems poised to become an immediate Vintage staple, and possibly not just in colorless decks. Will the card be restricted? Will it be restricted before Champs? With the next schedule B&amp;R announcement set to take place between the Eternal Weekends of North America and Europe, will there be two different formats? Hot takes abound in this lively Vintage B&amp;R announcement discussion.</p>
<p>As with everything in life, good things can get better, and we take a look at the TSI: The Land suggestion box. Recovery is important! Look out for the survey all you The Land attendees. </p>
<p>Finally, as we are wont to do, we check in at the B.C Druid Swag Corner to get the low down on the most swag and ANTI-swag things you can do as a Magic player. Plus, we debut a new format: Draft Super Fight!</p>
<p>Outro is by Oldominion and is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLOnGichrE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Precise Danger</a>. Used by permission, <a href="https://www.zebdak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Momentum Studios PDX</a>.</p>
