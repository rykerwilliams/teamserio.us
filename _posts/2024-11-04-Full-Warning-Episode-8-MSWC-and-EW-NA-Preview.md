<p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>
<p>The recent restrictions in Vintage have caused a shake up for Team Serious and it ain&#39;t good. As primarily paper players who participate only a few times a year, restriction action this close to Eternal Weekend has had a pretty big impact on the hype for the Vintage tournament, especially after our recent pre-restriction TSI. Que sera sera.</p>
<p><br>After a brief discussion of our current magic doings, the online league hosted by Romancing the Stones, Angelo and I dig in to the new landscape of Vintage. We review Eternal Weekend Asia Vintage results, to see what has shifted. Mainly, I rant about what they should have done and when they should have done it. Anyway, it seems like THE CAT still rules the day, and we have no real suggestions for non-cat players, but we do explore some interesting options. And we get a bit emo about deck choices and the reality of playing Vintage only a few times a year.</p>
<p><br>In the second segment, we generate engagement with a shocking reveal; I have been playing CEDH and now, No Banned List Commander. We chat about the recent EDH bans and their impact on Angelo&#39;s decks. If you came here for this, check the chapter markers to jump right to the Commander content you crave! For real though, NBL seems pretty fun. Try it out! Proxy up some power and new border cards you don&#39;t own and jam with your friends.<br>The final Magic segment is what most people <em>*actually*</em> came here for, where we are joined by Middle School World Championships Tournament Organizer and gravy connoisseur Eric Caffrey. As is usual, Eric takes us off on many tangents, but we get some food suggestions out of it. Check the links for some of his picks.</p>
<p><br>And of course, don&#39;t forget to sign up for the Middle School World Championships 2024. Check the links, all information for the tournament is in the registration link. We did come up with a charity to benefit, a suggestion from our friends The Three Rivers Wizards. If you are inclined, we are benefiting The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Donations are not required to register, but check the links for donation information.<br></p>
<p>We close out this episode with the Swag Corner: Food Edition! I talk about stew, Angelo reveals his new Sunday indulgence and Eric reviews his Middle School Thanksgiving tournament with all the fixings.</p>
<p><br>The outro is by onesevenbeatxs, a producer out of India. Sounded cool and it is cleared.</p>

### Key Takeaways

â€¢ The loss of powerful cards like Vexing Bauble and Urza's Saga has made the Vintage format less straightforward for some players, leading them to consider simpler artifact strategies like Affinity or Workshops.

â€¢ The hosts debate whether Wizards made the right call in restricting Lurrus over Urza's Saga, suggesting that the Vintage metagame may not be as balanced and exciting as they would prefer.

â€¢ The hosts acknowledge Wizards' efforts to curate the Vintage format, but wish for a more balanced and exciting metagame going forward.

### Detailed Summary

Roger and BC Druid discuss the changing landscape of Vintage Magic with the recent card restrictions. BC Druid shares that he enjoyed playing Vintage with the power of Vexing Bauble and Urza's Saga, as it allowed him to approach the format in a more straightforward way, without needing deep knowledge of the metagame. With these key cards now restricted, BC Druid is unsure of how to proceed, but is considering simpler artifact-based strategies like Affinity or Workshops to maintain a competitive edge, rather than engaging with the nuanced "dance" of Vintage deckbuilding. The hosts explore how the post-restriction format may evolve and what strategies players might gravitate towards. The speakers discuss the decision tree and flexibility provided by the card Vexing Bauble in Vintage Magic: The Gathering. They compare it to the feel-bad experience of getting locked out of a game by cards like Karn. The speakers also analyze the recent restrictions of Urza's Saga and Lurrus of the Dream-Den, debating whether Saga should have been restricted instead of Lurrus, as Saga enabled powerful colorless strategies. They conclude that Wizards of the Coast has pushed the power level of recent cards too far, but appreciate the ability to curate the Vintage format through card restrictions. The discussion revolves around the recent restrictions in Vintage, particularly the restriction of Urza's Saga. The speaker expresses frustration with Wizards' decision-making, arguing that they should have restricted the "Unwastable" card first, before restricting Urza's Saga. The speaker also laments how this decision has dampened their excitement for the upcoming Vintage tournament and the "lame duck format." However, the speaker remains optimistic about the metagame, highlighting the interesting decks that emerged from the Eternal Weekend Asia event, including Bug Lurrus, Esper Lurrus, and Oops! All Spells. The speaker suggests that Wizards should reconsider the Urza's Saga restriction, as the Lurrus decks still seem to be dominant. The speakers discuss various Magic: The Gathering decks, focusing on an Esper Control deck featuring Lurrus and the powerful new card Pyroglyph. They analyze how Pyroglyph combines with Broadside Bombardiers to deliver devastating damage. The speakers also highlight the strength of Fable the Mirror Breaker and the utility of Stonecoil Serpent as a solution to the challenging Psychic Frog deck. Overall, the conversation provides insights into the current metagame and effective deck-building strategies. The speakers discuss a powerful defensive card called Stonecoil Serpent, which provides protection from multicolor threats and has trample. They suggest building a deck around this card, possibly with a "shop stack" strategy, to gain immunity from powerful threats like Oko. The speakers also touch on the demanding nature of playing grindy control decks that require intense focus, compared to more straightforward aggro strategies. Ultimately, the Asia Vintage Championship was won by Yuta Yokokawa playing a deck featuring the powerful flip planeswalker Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. The speakers are discussing a powerful card in Magic: The Gathering that can be a long-term investment. It's a grind-heavy card that flips into a powerful Planeswalker with abilities that can help you survive and regain advantage. The Planeswalker ultimate provides a huge card advantage, but it takes several turns to reach. The speakers are also discussing strategies around this card, such as using proliferate or time manipulation to speed up the ultimate. Overall, this card seems to offer significant value, but requires a patient, grinding approach to maximize its potential. In this podcast discussion, the speakers explore the world of competitive Commander (cEDH) and the recent ban list changes by the Commander rules committee. One speaker, a relative newcomer to cEDH, shares his experiences trying out the format with proxy decks and finding it enjoyable when playing with the right mindset. However, the ban on powerful cards has led their playgroup to explore a new format - No Ban List Commander. The other speaker, Angelo, shares his more casual approach to Commander, focusing on building fun decks around commanders he enjoys, rather than acquiring expensive staple cards. The discussion highlights the diverse perspectives and experiences within the Commander community. In this discussion, the speakers examine the issues surrounding the "no banned list" format in Commander (EDH) Magic: The Gathering. They acknowledge the potential for abuse, with powerful cards like Mox Diamond and Mox Opal enabling swingy, overpowered gameplay. However, they also recognize that banning specific cards, like Scheherazade, creates a nuanced "no-ban list" approach. The speakers suggest that players drawn to this format are likely to gravitate towards commanders like Golos or Kenrith, which offer built-in win conditions when combined with infinite mana. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and divisive nature of this format within the Commander community. The speakers discuss the power of infinite mana combos in the Commander format, highlighting how players can unleash devastating attacks using commanders like Kenrith. They delve into specific combo strategies, such as the Protean Hulk combo and the Cephalid Breakfast mill deck, as well as the strength of commanders like Leovold and Urza. The conversation emphasizes the thrill of playing in an unrestrained, no-ban list environment where players can explore the limits of their deckbuilding creativity. The speakers discussed the upcoming Eternal Weekend North America tournament in Pittsburgh. While one speaker is not excited about playing Vintage and will not be attending, the other plans to test various decks like Doomsday and Eldrazi in the weeks leading up to the event. They also briefly mentioned the Middle School World Championships 2024, which appears to be the only one of its kind. Overall, the conversation focused on the logistics of the tournament and the evolving Vintage metagame. In the discussion, Eric and Ty are reminiscing about the first annual "Eternal Weekend Middle School World Championships" event they hosted in 2023. They held the 20-round tournament at a bar called Sly Fox in the South Side of Pittsburgh, and designed custom trophies made by their friend Sam using a 3D printer. The event was well-received, with around 20 players attending, some of whom had started in the Legacy tournament earlier that day.

This year, the Middle School World Championships will be held again on November 23rd, 2024, giving players a chance to compete in the unique format after playing Legacy. Eric mentions that they are open to lending out decks for those who don't have one, though the decks may be a bit "weird" since the format is not very established. Overall, the event seems like a fun and quirky gathering for players to enjoy a lesser-known Magic format. The speakers discuss the upcoming casual Magic: The Gathering event, emphasizing that players should feel free to attend and play, regardless of the cards they own. They encourage using proxies or creating decks that represent the cards you want to play, as the goal is to have fun and socialize, not to win at all costs. The speakers also share deck building advice, noting that non-blue decks often run similar cards, and that there's no need to perfectly copy tournament lists. The overall message is to come, play, and enjoy the event without worrying too much about the specifics of your deck. In this podcast discussion, the speakers analyze their recent experiences playing in a Middle School Magic: The Gathering league. One speaker recounts a close match where they were outmaneuvered by their opponent's Psychotog deck, despite having some strong counters in hand. The speakers then discuss the unique venue for the Middle School World Championships, which will be held at a bar and grill called Sly Fox. They highlight the casual, inclusive nature of the event, which offers prizes for different categories beyond just the top finishers. The speakers encourage listeners to register for the tournament and explore the creative deck-building possibilities within the Middle School format. Eric organized a middle school Magic: The Gathering tournament and put together an entire Thanksgiving-style meal for the 8 players who attended. Despite the stuffing being a bit dry, the meal was delicious, and the players had a great time enjoying the food and the tournament. This thoughtful gesture by Eric helped create a warm, community-focused event for the middle school Magic enthusiasts. Angelo and the host discuss their love for hearty, indulgent meals, from devouring an entire Bloomin' Onion by himself at Outback Steakhouse to savoring the delicious and filling Pittsburgh hash at Pamela's Diner in Pittsburgh. They bond over their shared appreciation for these satisfying dining experiences, acknowledging the potential health consequences, but agreeing that the joy of indulging in such comfort foods is worth it. The host also highlights a memorable meatball-focused restaurant near the convention center in Pittsburgh that they recommend trying during future trips. It sounds like you're looking for a quintessential Pittsburgh experience with hearty, Yingling-soaked food and Dad's Hat whiskey. For a true local flavor, I'd recommend hitting up one of the neighborhood spots that serves up Pittsburgh staples like zucchini and Italian beef soup, topped with a creamy ricotta and mozzarella crema. And don't forget to grab an icy Iron City beer with a lime wedge to make it drinkable. As for the Eternal Weekend event, it seems to be more about the community gathering than the competitive tournament these days, but the middle school format could bring some exciting new energy to the festivities. The speakers discuss their love for the format of the game Magic: The Gathering, particularly the "draw-go" control style that can captivate younger players. They share stories of hosting tournaments and creating a welcoming community, even for those who may not be as competitive. The speakers express excitement for the upcoming Eternal Weekend event, where they hope to reconnect with friends and enjoy the camaraderie of the game, regardless of their individual tournament success. In this lively podcast discussion, the speakers cover a range of topics related to the Magic: The Gathering community. They discuss the merits of the card Pyro Goyf, the excitement around Eternal Weekend 2024 in Pittsburgh, and the importance of coming together as a community to enjoy the game and each other's company. The speakers emphasize the value of creating a welcoming and "rowdy" atmosphere for players, fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared experiences within the Team Sirius community. Overall, the conversation highlights the passion and enthusiasm the speakers have for the game and their community.

### Detailed Summary

In this podcast discussion, hosts Roger James and BC Druid explore the current state of the Vintage Magic: The Gathering format in a post-restriction world. BC Druid, a regular Vintage player, shares his perspective on how the restrictions of powerful cards like Vexing Bauble and Urza's Saga have impacted the format. He admits that he prefers a more straightforward, "hammer-like" approach to Vintage, rather than the nuanced strategies required before the changes. The hosts speculate on how the metagame might shift, with BC Druid suggesting he may turn to Affinity or other artifact-focused decks as a way to simplify his approach to the format. The speakers discuss the Vintage format and the impact of the card Vexing Bauble. They note that Vexing Bauble allows players to engage with Vintage without needing to know all the intricacies of the format, as it turns off many key decisions. While restricting the card could be reasonable, the speakers argue that Vintage benefits from the ability to restrict cards, unlike Modern or Legacy. They also discuss the powerful card Urza's Saga and how its restriction paired with Vexing Bauble provides an interesting dynamic in the format. Overall, the conversation highlights the nuances of curating a healthy Vintage metagame through strategic card restrictions. The discussion centers around a new powerful blue card that can be played in any deck running islands, and the potential issues it may cause in the Vintage format. The speakers express concerns that the card may have been "pushed too far" compared to previous one-mana cyclers, and that it should have been restricted rather than the Urza's Saga card. They also mention that the new restrictions have dampened their excitement for the upcoming Eternal Weekend tournament, as even decks like Dredge have been "nerfed" by the changes. However, the speakers transition to discussing the top decks from the recent Eternal Weekend Asia event, which feature a variety of archetypes like Lurrus, Shops, and Esper Control, providing an interesting glimpse into the current state of Vintage. The speaker discusses several decks that have performed well in recent Vintage tournaments, including "Oops All Spells," Esper Lurrus control, Jewel Shop, and an "Unpowered Mono Red Prison" deck. They highlight the prevalence of the Lurrus companion in these top decks and suggest that restricting the Lorian Revealed card could help address this. The speaker is particularly intrigued by the Mono Red Prison deck, which seems to feature cards like Magus of the Moon, Rabblemaster, and a new card called Pyrogoif that deals significant damage when it enters the battlefield. The speakers discuss the intricacies of the Fable of the Mirror Breaker clone and the power of the Stone Coil Serpent card in the current Magic: The Gathering meta. They highlight how the Stone Coil Serpent's protection from multicolor and reach make it an effective counter to the popular Psychic Frog card. The speakers also touch on the challenges of playing grindy control decks like Esper Control, noting the mental stamina required to navigate the complex decision trees across multiple rounds in a tournament setting. The speakers discuss the different approaches and mindsets when playing Magic: The Gathering. One player prefers a more focused, hyper-competitive style, while the other values playing fair and enjoying the game, even if it means losing to a stronger opponent. They also analyze the powerful Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student planeswalker card, which can quickly flip and provide significant value through card draw and spell recursion. The speakers highlight Tamiyo's defensive abilities and the potential to ultimate the planeswalker in just a few turns, potentially leading to a game-winning advantage. In this discussion, the speakers explore the nuances of certain Magic: The Gathering strategies and decks, particularly around the Bowmaster deck and the use of cards like Ray of Enfeeblement. They also discuss attending the upcoming Eternal Weekend event, with one speaker planning to attend but not participate in the Vintage tournament. Instead, the speaker requests a "grill punched" or panini-style sandwich to be delivered while they wait in line, indicating a lighthearted and humorous tone. Additionally, the speakers delve into the speaker's experience with playing cEDH (competitive Commander) in a more pure, throwdown format, noting the challenges of navigating the politics involved in the format. The speakers discuss their experiences with using proxy decks and the recent changes to the Commander ban list. One speaker, who had printed proxy versions of top Commander decks to try them out, found that playing with the right people and mindset made for an enjoyable experience. However, the ban list changes implemented by the Commander rules committee have led the group to explore a "No Ban List" variant, which the speaker has been eager to try. The other speaker, Angelo, shares his perspective, noting that while he doesn't own the most powerful Commander staples, the ban list changes have not significantly impacted his decks. The discussion touches on the broader issues surrounding the growth and evolution of the Commander format, including concerns about the potential for cheating and the need to find the right balance between competitive and casual play. In this discussion, the speakers explore the concept of "no banned list" Commander, where the usual banned cards in the format are now legal to play. The key insights are:

- The deck construction rules remain the same, but cards on the regular banned list are now allowed, with one exception - Scheherazade is still banned.
- Players are likely to gravitate towards powerful five-color commanders like Golos and Kenrith, as they provide built-in win conditions when combined with infinite mana combos.
- Protean Hulk is a popular combo piece that can fetch the necessary cards to draw the entire deck and win the game in this format. The speakers discuss various strategies and combos in Commander Duel Highlander (CDH) formats, including using cards like Blood Pet, Cephalid Breakfast, and Decon to mill or disrupt opponents. They mention powerful commanders like Urza and Kinnin, and discuss the challenges of facing these decks. The speakers encourage building powerful, unrestrained decks and playing more cards like Stifle and Trickery to counter the dominant strategies. They also share personal anecdotes about their experiences with their kids and families. The speakers discuss the upcoming Eternal Weekend North America event in Pittsburgh, focusing on their plans for the Vintage format. One speaker expresses a lack of excitement for the current Vintage metagame, noting that the restriction changes have left some players less interested in the format. However, they anticipate that more casual Vintage players may show up to play "bizarre decks" that are now more viable without the presence of Vexing Bubble. The speakers also discuss the logistics of booking lodging for the event, with one speaker proposing a randomized approach to ensure someone takes responsibility for it. Overall, the conversation highlights the evolving nature of the Vintage format and the efforts to prepare for the upcoming tournament. The speakers discuss their plans to explore some new Magic: The Gathering decks, including Doomsday, Artifacts, and Eldrazi. They then turn their attention to the upcoming Middle School World Championships in 2024, which will be the second edition of this event. Eric, the host of the inaugural tournament in 2023, is set to join the conversation, but is delayed due to a work commitment. Once Eric joins, the speakers plan to discuss the details of the upcoming Middle School Worlds, including the format, location, and registration information. Eric and his friend Sam have been hosting a successful annual Middle School Magic tournament in Pittsburgh, with custom-made trophies designed by Sam. The event is returning on November 23rd, 2024, and they're hoping to attract even more players this year. Eric notes that they moved the start time to allow players who participate in the Legacy tournament earlier in the day to also join the Middle School event. While not many players crossed over last year, they're still expecting a good turnout and are happy to lend out unique, quirky decks to anyone who wants to participate but doesn't have their own. The event seems to be a fun, community-driven celebration of an engaging vintage Magic format. The speakers are discussing playing in the Middle School Magic: The Gathering format. They encourage players to use proxy decks if they don't have the actual cards, emphasizing that the goal is to come out and have fun playing, not to win at all costs. Angelo shares that he plans to stick with the same deck until he wins a tournament with over 16 players, while Eric reveals his current 1-3 record in the Stones League, noting that his slow deck has struggled against powerful cards like Intuition. The overall message is one of camaraderie and enjoying the game, even if you don't have the most optimized deck. The speakers discuss various Magic: The Gathering decks and strategies, including the use of AK (Arcane Denial) and Psychotog. They talk about the challenges of building and piloting certain decks, such as a "bug deck" with 16 counterspells and Pernicious Deeds, and the difficulties of facing a Psychotog deck. The conversation also touches on upcoming Middle School World Championship tournament, where players can bring creative and unconventional decks to compete for prizes. The speakers encourage each other to experiment with unique deck ideas, even if they may not be the most competitive, as long as they have a chance of winning games. Eric and his friends discuss their upcoming Middle School Magic tournament, which has a 48-player cap. Eric is hoping to hit over 24 registrants, and they consider adding a charitable donation component to the event. The group reminisces about past middle school tournaments, noting the great community and camaraderie. They then move on to discussing food-themed Magic swag, acknowledging that they haven't played much in-person Magic lately due to the pandemic, but are excited to gather the community again for the upcoming tournament. Angelo recently hosted a middle school Magic: The Gathering tournament where he went all out, preparing an entire Thanksgiving feast for the participants. Despite a minor issue with the stuffing, the meal was a hit, and the event provided a fun opportunity for the young players to experience the format and make deck adjustments before upcoming events. While Angelo couldn't attend the tournament himself due to other commitments, he's proud of the creative prizes and welcoming atmosphere he was able to create, proving that there's more to hosting a successful tournament than just the gameplay. The speakers discuss the joys of visiting a pub in Pittsburgh that serves cold, cheap beer like Fosters and the Bloomin' Ale, as well as delicious local dishes like the Pittsburgh Hash with sauerkraut and kielbasa.

The speakers also mention that the dish was a hit with the father-in-law, though the wife got the credit.
