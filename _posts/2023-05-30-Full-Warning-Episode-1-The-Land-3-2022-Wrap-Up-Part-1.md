## Show Notes from Spotify

<p><strong>What </strong></p>
<p>This is Full Warning: A Team Serious podcast, spiritual cousin to the Serious Vintage podcast. This space will be home to the magical, both vintage non-vintage, and of course the non magical exploits of Team Serious. And as always, food talk.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Who</strong></p>
<p>The show will feature a variety of hosts, as we aim for this to be a Team platform for podcast content. The first episodes will feature Angelo and myself hosting but as we get up and running, we hope to bring in Geoff Moes, Josh Chapple and many other Seriousos, as schedules allow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Where</strong></p>
<p>Team Serious members live worldwide with a local focus on Ohio and the Midwest.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>When</strong></p>
<p>We will publish episodes periodically, usually after events or significant occurrences, or whenever someone produces a new show. Make sure to subscribe to our feeds for notification of new shows.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>Mainly. More content!</p>
<p>We envision this as a life and Times podcast, mostly targeted at our future selves. And maybe some others will enjoy it too.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Intro Episode 001</strong></p>
<p>We have a few things in the can from the last few years and this is one of them. Recorded just after the Land 3 wrapped in June 2022, this episode features guests Stu Ziarnik and Kai Schaifroth.So without further preamble, I present: TSI: The Land 3 wrap up podcast, part 1.

<strong>Social</strong></p>
