HSI 7 returned to Columbus for 2024 and we chatted with Jimmy, the defending and repeat champion about his run through the tournament. The Top 8 recap was slightly re-imagined by Jimmy, apparently smashing his opponents so relentlessly that the beatings all blurred together. While there is written evidence of matches played, we are unsure if the Top 8 Bracket was constructed correctly. Jimmy says it was. 1000% Serious indeed!

After that, we solve the Vintage B&R, of course. Here's the list of what we should unrestrict next, according to Jimmy:

1 Merchant Scroll
2 Yawgmoth's Will
3 Necropotence
4 Narset, Parter of Veils
5 Monastery Mentor
6 Thorn of Amethyst

I'm not sure what social media you can find him at to yell at him about his hot takes, but you can yell at us on our brand new social handles!

We wrap up the show with a little Columbus food talk, followed by our newest segment, "Angelo's Swag Corner". Until next time!

Thanks as always to the Hazard family for opening their home to all of *Those Ohio Idiots* once again. Happy Birthday Matt!

## Philanthropy

As it was last year, Matt asked particpants to donate to the Clintonville Community Resource Center ([Clintonville CRC](https://www.clintonvillecrc.org/)), an organization in his community that serves families in need. The CRC also benefits families from the surrounding communities as well, working towards a Vision for "A community of resilient, connected, and thriving neighbors".

With the addition of the benefit of the Chaos Draft the day before, as well as generous matching, Team Serious was able to make a donation to the CRC of over  ***$1200***.
