## Grandpa Belcher’s World Famous Pub Quiz

As the Top 8 of Vintage began, Nat hosted his World Famous Pub Quiz (WFPQ)!

![Serious Triva](../assets/images/2022/06/04/PXL_20220604_235313161.jpg)

Four Teams formed to battle it out for the true Glory of The Land.

1. Team "Awesome" - Rajah, Ben, Rob, Joe, Hazard (Quotation marks added by Nat)

1. "Kevin Poenisch by Himself" - Eric, Kevin, Angelo, Kevin

1. Team Mean Reflect Bus - JR, Andy, Jimmy, David

1. "Dr. Steven B. Morbius" - Steven, Mike O, Jake B., Bob

Rounds included classic Pub themes such as *Dogs* and *Blues Brothers*, along with Magic related categories and an amazing Lightning Round.

It was clear from the beginning that allowing the super team of Mean Reflect Bus to come together was a mistake; they ran away with the victory. While Hazard was able to hold down Team “Awesome” with a near-perfect score in the *Blues Brother’s* category, JR’s virtuoso performance in the “Lightning Round” category *Wrestling with Film* capped off their near flawless victory.

Congrats to Team Mean Reflect Bus for taking home the Trivia Gold! And huge thank you to Nat for hosting!

## Cake

We had not one but two birthdays on the weekend! First up was Ben Revell celebrating 40 years! We enjoyed German Chocolate cake on Friday to celebrate.

We also helped Nat celebrate the BIG 40 with a cake and singing!

To the relief of some and the regret of others, no spankings were distributed to either birthday boy. That I know of.

## Crackin’ Boosties: Mystery Booster Convention Edition

Nam had a box of the much sought after “Convention Edition” of the Mystery Boosters. He didn’t want to draft himself but would enjoy his box getting opened, so we did it!

Angelo
Chad
Mike O
Eric / McGrew
Kevin Poensich
David Lance
Rajah
Ben Revell

The finals featured Angelo on a nasty fast Green deck with Beastmaster’s Ascension and some super dope Convention cards vs. Rajah on a mostly mono-black deck featuring Meren, Mortapod, and Reassembling Skeleton. Angelo smashed face and prevailed as the Mystery Booster Convention Edition Champion!
