# Team Serious Invitational - Hazard Serious Invitational 7
*event report by Rajah James*

We recorded a podcast about the HSI 7 and that included some summary info and timestamps info.

[Check that out here!]({% post_url 2024-04-16-Full-Warning-Episode-4-HSI-7--Vintage-BR-and-Columbus-Food-Talk %})


## Philanthropy

As it was last year, Matt asked particpants to donate to the Clintonville Community Resource Center ([Clintonville CRC](https://www.clintonvillecrc.org/)), an organization in his community that serves families in need. The CRC also benefits families from the surrounding communities as well, working towards a Vision for "A community of resilient, connected, and thriving neighbors".

With the addition of the benefit of the Chaos Draft the day before, as well as generous matching, Team Serious was able to make a donation to the CRC of over  ***$1200***.
