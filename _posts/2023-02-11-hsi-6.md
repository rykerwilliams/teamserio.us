# Team Serious Invitational - Hazard Serious Invitational 6
*event report by Rajah James*

<img src="../assets/images/2023/02/11/7bCC1a855A.jpg" alt="HSI 6 Promotional Flyer" height="600"/>

After a hiatus in 2021, Hazardvitational returned this year for the 6th installment. We join our hero in the midst of a house move and familial growth, a hectic time for even such a monumental mage such as Matt Hazard. With the blessing of his partner, he endeavoured to once again bring the team together in celebration of his birth, with friendship and cards. 

With such things filling his mind day to day, he enlisted me to help put things together and herd the cats as best as possible. As I am wont to do, I set about making some promotional materials. See above :)

Folks were generally stoked already to come together and especially more so since only me and Duane got to meet at Eternal Weekend; last TSI was The Land 3 in June 2022 and folks were pretty excited to play Vintage. Thanks as always to the Hazard family for opening their home to all of *Those Ohio Idiots* once again. Happy Birthday Matt!

## Philanthropy

This year, Matt asked particpants to donate to the Clintonville Community Resource Center ([Clintonville CRC](https://www.clintonvillecrc.org/)), an organization in his community that serves families in need. The CRC also benefits families from the surrounding communities as well, working towards a Vision for "A community of resilient, connected, and thriving neighbors".

Thanks to the very generous contributions of Team Serious memebers, we were able to make a massive ***$815*** donation to the CRC in honor of Matt and Dr. T.P. Serious!

## Pre-Tournament Gathering
Folks from beyond Ohio were coming in to town for the gathering, so two AirBnBs were acquired. In a new twist on responsiblity sharing, those interested in staying signed up and Josh rolled to randomly assign the responsibility of booking the spot. Also noted was the fact that we got more than one AirBnB; weirdly, stacking 8 deep into a 2 man hotel room doesn't have the same appeal as it for some reason did years ago. #old

Folks started to descend upon Columbus and surrounding areas on Thursday or so. The tournament venue is conveniently located near a lot of eateries and provions suppliers in Columbus. The AirBnBs were well stocked.

## Stream

I initially wanted to do some remote commentary for the stream. I even asked Kevin Cron and he agreed to try it. But the reality of the coordination was a bit much.

Seriouso [Rob Wilson](https://twitter.com/Robert_H_Wilson) agreed to bring his very sophisticated [Buffalo Chicken Dip Legacy](https://twitter.com/BcdLegacy) setup to get us on stream. Big ups to Rob for his efforts to get us live. You can view the VODs of the stream on his channel for now: https://www.twitch.tv/BuffaloChickenDipLegacy

Look for them on the Team Serious YouTube channel around the twelfth of Perhaps Someday.

### Prize Table

As part of the entry fee, each participant donated a prize to the prize pool of $25 or greater value. After the swiss rounds, the Top 8 drafted prizes first, followed by the rest of the participants in Swiss placement order.

|Prizes|Prizes|

The prizes were deep and varied; the goal is that everyone is able to go home with something. In addition to the prize pool, we executed the now traditional 'group signed' cards. I brought a pile of Vintage playables for folks to choose from; many folks put a particular card into the pool that they wanted for a deck.

## Trivia

As the Top 8 started up, the REAL tournmanent was about to begin; [Nat](https://twitter.com/GrandpaBelcher) patiently waited to deploy his latest Trivia creation on the team. I am enamored with the Nat's wonderful ability to mix media and subject matter, making seemingly the perfect combination of magic and muggle questions for our age bracket. Folks were weirdly very into playing magic cards; I expected more participation overall.

Team JS, Team "Eric B 'n Marky T", Team Glodberg, and Team Hazard duked it out for Trivia supremacy.

One of my favorite rounds was the "Hazard's Deck Round." We were given the partially filled in decklist of the Matt Hazard Legacy Runner-Up Belcher deck, and we were to fill in the missing cards. I think Matt missed 3 or 4 out of his own deck; he said some of the SB cards never came in and were, as such, forgettable. #FTaiga

In the end, Team Glodberg was victorious, winning the competition by only a single point!

## Top 8

As is tradition, Top 8 Participants were obliged to imbibe a "YangTime":tm:. (Not endorsed by Jerry Yang in any way)

## Finals

After 5 rounds of Swiss and battling through the eliminiation rounds, it came down to The Brass Man vs. The Jimmy in the end. Andy fought hard but Jimmy's Bird deck eventually prevailed against Andy's Cat deck.
